General
-------
- Use IRequestInfoService to access details of the HTTP request.

Database
--------
- There are two types of database used:
	- Shared database. Contains tenant list etc.
	- Tenant database. Contains data for tenant.
- To create a service that accesses the shared DB then pass IDatabaseConfig to the service constructor.
- To create a service that accesses the tenant DB then pass ITenantDatabaseConfig to the service contructor.

Dependency Injection
--------------------
- To resolve a tenant specific service outside of the HTTP pipeline then create a scope, get ICurrentTenantContext,
  set the tenant and then resolve the other services. Setting tenant ICurrentTenantContext causes DI resolution of
  ITenantDatabaseConfig to resolve the correct tenant.

Models
------
- Internal models are mapped to DTO models for the API.

System Tasks
------------
- System tasks run in the background.
- They can be executed at scheduled intervals or on demand (E.g. When data changes)
